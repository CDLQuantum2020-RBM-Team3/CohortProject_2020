# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consider the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

*early brainstorming bullets-- feel free to delete/change/simplify and expand on*

Overall: Optimization, in application of studying energy of molecules

- Task 2: Optimization problem with exponential speedup: minimized the hidden units and training samples necessary for training the RBM
- D-Wave: **Figuring out**

Example: Finding a global minimum in settings where a classical approach may not be able to find a global minimum.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Optimizing data
- financial applications -- map financial data to a Hamiltonian 
- Pharma applications -- searching for ideal molecules
- ...

Example: A courier has to deliver parcels to several locations and is looking to minimize its travel time. (e.g., “the travelling salesman problem”).

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

- Big Pharma
- Big Banks
- ...

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.

- exponential reduction in storage, ex) 201 numbers vs 10^30 data points
    - on top of that, we're quadratically decreasing the testing data necessary, to improve computational speeds
